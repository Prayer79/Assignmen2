# Paint Coverage Calculator

A simple **TypeScript project** that calculates how much paint is required to cover a given canvas area. This project also includes **unit tests** to ensure accurate results.

---

## 📌 **How the Calculation Works**
The amount of paint required is determined using the formula:

Where:
- **Area** = `Width × Length`
- **Coverage Per Liter** = The area that one liter of paint can cover.

For example:

Paint Required = (10 × 5) / 10 = 5 liters
